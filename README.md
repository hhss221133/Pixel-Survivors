Project Details:
1. Pixel Survivors

2. A registration/login form and a how-to-play section

3. It is a 2D pixel co-op game where players work together to defeat a boss that spawns several other enemies. The win condition is to deplete the boss' Hit Points (HP) while maximising their score (by damaging the boss and other enemies), If a player loses all HP (dead), he will revive after 15 seconds.

4. When a game ends, the players will be redirected to the ranking page. The ranks are based on the clear time of the game and scores of the two players are shown.

5. Cheat mode can be toggled in the game by pressing BACKSPACE key, and the damage and walking speed of the players increases significantly.
