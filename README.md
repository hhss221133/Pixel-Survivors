# Pixel-Survivors
COMP4021 Group 3 Final Project

Project Details:
1. Pixel Survivors

2. A registration/login form and a how-to-play section

3. It is a 2D pixel co-op game where players work together to defeat a boss that spawns several other enemies. The win condition is to deplete the boss' Hit Points (HP) while maximising their score (by damaging the boss), players lose when all players lose all HP, or if the time runs out (4 minutes). If a player loses all HP (dead), another player can revive the dead player. Reviving can also add points. A dead player will revive after 15 seconds if they are not revived by another player.

4. The game over page will display a win/loss screen. When a player wins their individual scores will be displayed along with the completion time -and it will be listed on a rankings page. When a player loses only the damage statistics will be displayed.

5. Cheating can be toggled in the game by pressing a key, and the damage output of the players increases significantly.
